The BEB-BRP model is used to revise these blocks so that they are feasible by serving them with a fleet of additional backup buses. The best solution in this case dispatches 10 backup buses.\n",

First, this includes info about the conflict sets that are populated to create queue prevention constraints. In this case, the mean size of each conflict set is 4.79. Then we get updates on the solution progress as we generate constraints lazily whenever they are violated.
